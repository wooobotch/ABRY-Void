# ABRY Void Linux

It's been a long time since I started *automating* a little my first setups for debian based distros. But it came to an end: a lot of resources consumed for unncesesary packages and services I don't think I'd ever use.

This is not a fork of my former ABRY-Ubuntu because I expect it to take a fresher path with it's own features and stuff.

If you are feeling corious about what it does, take a little read of what it does, read the shell script.
